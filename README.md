## Background
An excitingg area of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site from which the data was obtained:

## Aim
Development of a tidy data set containing a list of averages for the mean and standard deviation variables generated by Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers (detailed within the code book) while test subjects carried out the following activities: 

	1 - WALKING

	2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS

	3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

	4 - SITTING

	5 - STANDING

	6 - LAYING


## Method
The R script called run_analysis.R performs the following:
Note, steps 1) and 2) can be skiped if the zip file has already been downloaded and unziped in the working directory.

	1. Downloads the zip data file into your working directory from the following web location:
	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
	2. Unzips the file
	3. reads in the required training and test data sets
	4. mearges the trianing and test sets to create one data set (part 1)
	5. labels the data set with descriptive variable names (part 4)
	6. names the activities in the data set using the above activities (part 3)
	7. extracts the variables associated with mean (46) and standard deviation (33) detailed within the code book (part 2)
	8. generates and saves the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in a tidy data set (part 5)
	9. saves the tidy data set as a txt file called FinalData.txt

## Read in the tidy data

The tidy data set (FinalData.txt) can be read into R using the following code:

  final.data <- read.table(file=paste0(filepath,"FinalData.txt"), header = TRUE)
  View(final.data)
